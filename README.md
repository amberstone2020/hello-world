# hello-world
My First Repository
I'm Amber and my interests are all over the place in tech. I'm currently in college and I do a lot of self-study. I'm doing a Python 3 tutorial on Udemy before classes start back next month. I love tech podcasts, reading Medium, and have recently started blogging about my coding journey. I'm very interested in contributing to open-source and everyone has to start somewhere!
